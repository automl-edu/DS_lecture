	\begin{frame}{Introduction to Overfitting}
	    In the previous lectures, our goal has been to minimize a loss function (MSE)
	    \begin{itemize}
	        \item We do this by collecting more features, or through feature engineering
	    \end{itemize}
	    \bigskip
	    However, we only ever evaluated our model on the data on which it was trained
	    \begin{itemize}
	        \item The whole point in building a model is to learn something about the world
	        \item Why do we care about finding a   $\hat{Y}$   if we already know   Y  ?
	    \end{itemize}
	    \bigskip
	    We care about how well our model performs on new data, for which we want to predict Y\\
	    \bigskip
	    To the demo!

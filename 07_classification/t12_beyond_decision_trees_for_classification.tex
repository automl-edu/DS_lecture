                \item We could do the same exercise for regression
                \item Rather than using a linear model, we could build a regression tree

	\begin{frame}{Summary}
	    Decision trees provide an alternative non-linear framework for classification and regression
	    \begin{itemize}
	        \item The underlying principle is fundamentally different than in most other models
	        \item Decision boundaries can be more complex
	        \item Danger of overfitting is high
	    \end{itemize}
	    \bigskip
	    Keeping complexity under control is not nearly as mathematically elegant and\\ relies on heuristic rules
	    \begin{itemize}
	        \item Hard constraints
	        \item Pruning rules
	        \item Boostrapping (random forest)
	    \end{itemize}

	\begin{frame}{Summary}
	   In practice, you will see that there are actually even more conceptual frameworks for regression and classification:
	    \begin{itemize}
	        \item Linear models
	        \item Decision trees
	        \item Nearest neighbors
	        \item Support vector machines
	        \item Bayes Nets
            \item Neural networks / deep learning
	        \item And many many many many more $\leadsto$ 100+ more!
	    \end{itemize}
	    
	    \bigskip
	    
	    $\leadsto$ AutoML can even be used to selected between all of them ;-)
